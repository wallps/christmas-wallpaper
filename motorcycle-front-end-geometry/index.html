The Rake angle or Caster angle of the motorcycle along with the factors like Trail and Offset are the major elements responsible for the handling of the bike and the way it is going to be behaved on the road will be determined by these factors. Im thinking of using a front rake around 40 to 45 degrees and about 8 to 10 inches of trail. Trail is defined as the distance between the centre of the front tyres contact patch and the point where the steering axis meets the ground.

This gives the front end inherent self-centring properties that enhance stability. Motorcycle And Driver Geometry Center Of Gravity Position Scientific Diagram. The upper ends of the springer forks are connected to the rigid axle through the suspension components usually springs shocks or a combination of both.
