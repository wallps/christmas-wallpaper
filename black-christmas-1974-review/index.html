<p>More of a thriller than a true slasher by today’s standards, this small budget canadian film all but disappeared before tv stations started playing the film much to it’s audiences delight.

<p>Thank you for the review and reminding me of the humour in black christmas, made me smile 🙂. But this one contains very little holiday cheer. Weiler reviewed “black christmas” for the new york times on oct. More of a thriller than a true slasher by today’s standards, this small budget canadian film all but disappeared before tv stations started playing the film much to it’s audiences delight.
