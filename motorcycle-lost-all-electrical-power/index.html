<p>Sun Feb 28 2010 325 am. If the switch iisnot making its correct contacts it will cause voltage spikes that make the guage jump and if the power doesnt connect for a second it will set the coils to fire and cause backfire. I have checked the fuses on the main panel on the left side. I sprayed everything down with carb cleaner motor did not respond in anyway. So as I said if you power at the fuse not the main switch you have a damaged wire or corroded connector.</p>
<h3 id="leave-a-comment-uncategorized">Leave a Comment Uncategorized.</h3><p>When I was on my way home from work it did it again but this time the electrical didnt come back on. The bike runs good the rpm gauge will spike out and then shut off thats when the bike shuts off you let the bike set for a minute or 2 and then therell be a pop in the carburetor andy exhaust at that point I think the power turned back on. Motor died all the electics died nothing lit up anymore. I ALWAYS place a 5 or ten amp fuse in that test lead wire. But a bad starter would not stop your ride since the engine.</p>
