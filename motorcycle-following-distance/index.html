<p>By taking things slow you can decrease your braking distance and have time to access other factors on the road. One of the reasons motorcyclists need additional following distance involves the way that they come to a stop or slow down. I havent heard much talkinfo about this subject. Determining the three-second gap is relatively easy. Always watch your speed and following distance when driving in weather conditions like rain snow or ice. For further information on motorcycle stopping distances see the following resources.

<p>Riders are twenty-seven times more likely to die in roadway crashes than vehicle operators. Heres how it works. Keep a minimum following distance of two seconds between each motorcycle. The rule is a bit different however when it comes to following a motorcyclist. The two second following rule is used here and enforced to the rider immediately in front of you. Generally its best to give a three or four second following distance when travelling behind a motorcyclist. Pin On Sexy Biker 5.</p>
