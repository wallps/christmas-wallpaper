<p>My old short bed ford we had to do that for my friends big dog. The easiest and best way to haul a bike on the short bed is to make a c channel for the tires to rest on and they wont scoot left or right. Of course my Betas only about 220 wet so its really easy to load compared to a sport bike. As i already stated the angled approach can only work if your goal is to haul a single bike at once. Optional in bed storage system with locks to keep your tools secure. The motorcycle may be loaded into a 8 bed with or without the tailgate attached.

<p>The procedure highlighted above gives you enough guarantee that you and your property are safe during travel when you have your truck on board. I have a Yamaha WR250X myself but just an obvious reminder that anything you put in the bed is going to be exposed to the elements loading and unloading a motorcycle into a bed can be a bit tedious andor risky especially if doing it solo and theres always risk that either you overtighten the straps and damage the front suspension or go too loose and the bike could fall on a big bounce. Mine folds in half and fits nicely strapped in along the side of the bed. If you have a ditch by the edge of a road one right in front of my house you back up perpendicular to the road with your rear tires in the ditch. But if youre not sure measure the length of your bike and compare that to your trucks bed length. Start date Oct 6 2005.
