<p>Since a traditional level sensor for liquids would be impractical and ineffective for use in a fuel gauge on a motorcycle manufacturers would gave to invest heavily in developing new technologies to create a fuel level sensor that would work on a motorcycle no matter how far the bike was leaned over in a turn or what degree incline it was. It is a siphon that is powered by the fuel return line from the fuel pressure regulator. As this gas level can vary due to temperature of the propane as it expands and contracts and its affected by the angle of the tank the shape of the tank the amount of gas in the tank at a given time and the actual level of the vehicle the tanks. The Gas level shown in a GAS IT tank is fed to the outside gauge by a float system that physically floats on top of the liquid LPG in the tank and this level is given to the outside indicator. Device can be calibrated to compensate the shape of the fuel tank and shows real amount of fuel in the tank.</p>
